Hi ChatGPT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm diving into Linux virtual machine. 
Which virtual machine runs Ubuntu the best and most stable?

Hi ChatGPT! ðŸ‘‹ I'm diving into VirtualBox. 
Regarding the 2 VirtualBox Cons, currently I don't need to use a high-performance server, 
but I want to install VirtualBox on Ubuntu, then install Ubuntu on VirtualBox, will Ubuntu 
run well or should I install VirtualBox on Windows and then install Ubuntu on it?

I don't understand this:
sudo VBoxManage extpack install --replace <extension-pack-filename>
Can you suggest some extension-pack-filenames that people often use?

    VBoxManage list extpacks    ->  6.1.48  :   https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.48/
    sudo VBoxManage extpack install --replace Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.48.vbox-extpack
